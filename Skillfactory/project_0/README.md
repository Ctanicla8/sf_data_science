### Prodject description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions of the problem:**
- The computer guesses a number from 1 to 100, and we need to write a program that will guess the number in the minimum number of attempts.
- The algorithm must take into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.
- The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts per thousand repetitions.

**What are we practicing?**
Learn to write good code in Python.
